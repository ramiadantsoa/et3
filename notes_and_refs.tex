- Alder 2007 (a niche for neutrality the duration of drift until fixation  longer	 for large community and with strong negative density dependence). 

Question:
How extinction threshold changes as a function of niche width

Method:
Run IBM without competition (fix colonization rate, patch size, dispersal rate), vary aggregation 0 (dirac), ...0.5 (uniform), (also possible to find a trade-off between dispersal and niche width)

Answer:
fig1: x: niche width, y: extinction threshold, lines represent different degree of aggregation

Question:
Transient time as function of  magnitude of destruction

Method:
Run the same code above with different initial prevalence

Answer:
fig2: x: niche width, y: transient time, lines represent disturbance

or 
fig2: x: disturbance, y: transient time, lines represent niche width, panels can be different aggregation

Question:
What is the role of generalist species for transient time and extinction threshold

Method:
Make sure that coexistence is possible in the mean field
create a community of 2 specialists and add  1,2,4 generalists
create a community of 4 specialists and add 1,2,4 generalists

Answer:
fig3 x: niche width, y: extinction threshold 
  
  
Supplementary figure:
1- change colonization rate
2- change patch size
3- change dispersal rate  
  
Possible question: compare
